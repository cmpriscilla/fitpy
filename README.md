# FitPy
FitPy can be used to fit empirical data into various classes of discrete and continuous distributions based on derived MLEs (and Newton-Raphson numerical method where applicable). It can also propose the best distribution fit based on Pearsonâ€™s chi-squared goodness-of-fit and Epps-Singleton two-sample tests
